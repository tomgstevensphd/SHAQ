# SHAQ
SHAQ-Success and Happiness Attributes Questionnaire. Research validated online questionnaire. High correlations with life happiness, 
low depression anxiety, and success in career, education, relationhips, health, etc. Scales related to values, beliefs, life skills. 
SHAQ is one of most comprehensive personality tests ever written. Written in Lispworks. 
Its runtime version (too big for GIT) can be made with Lispworks application builder with this code.
Also requires files from MyUtilities branch (see config files for load files commands to see which ones).

Currently, working SHAQ online version is on my webite at web.csulb.edu/~tstevens/success. Download 2 exe files as per instructions on web page.
Contact me at tstevens@csulb.edu if questions.
